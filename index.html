          <h3>As a developer</h3>
          <p>
            I like building things, laying brick after brick adding details to
            turn the ideas to functional code for my clients. While writing code
            I try to make it self-explanatory, easy to maintain, and easily
            understandable. I love experimenting (always willing to adapt) with
            the code. The world of technology is growing and changing rapidly, I
            like being aligned with this speed and getting a chance to learn
            something new every day. I'm excited to work on new projects,
            because every new interaction with another person is another
            opportunity to not understand our world better, but also grow in it.
            I'm ready for the next challenge! And just as Rome was not built in
            a day, I'm ready to work hard towards perfection.

            I'm curious by nature and I love learning. I'm active, but also, I
            like to be present in the moment. I like to be creative and get
            inspiration from reading a good book, listening to the music and
            discovering the natural world around me. I pay close attention to
            details in my day-to-day life. I'm friendly and respectful towards
            myself and others.

            I am a good listener that understands there is value in every
            thought. I'm willing to admit my mistakes and learn from them,
            accepting feedback and implementing it to better my work. I respect
            time of my colleagues and I like to keep track of my time and make
            sure to meet deadlines.

        Front-End Web Developer based in Texas

      <div class="about-me__body">
        <p>
          I was born in a small town at the south of Ukraine, spent my childhood
          and youth there. I am currently living in Houston, Texas with my
          husband and our 5-year-old daughter. I'm fluent in Ukrainian, English,
          Turkish and russian. I was fortunate enough to experience life in
          multiple countries and got a chance to live those rich cultures.
          Finding similarities and things that are dimensionally opposite taught
          me that there is more than just black and white. Life is much more
          colorful than we realize. Destruction and horrors of the War in in my
          Ukraine changed me deeply and made me think more about values that I
          believe: human life, freedom and safe future for our children. I'm
          grateful for every day that I woke up with its happiness, sorrows,
          gains and struggles. Living in the United States presented me with a
          chance to begin a new chapter in my life, starting with a new career
          path. I'm thrilled towards new challenges and excitement for the
          future. Confidence is on my side and I'm ready to use it.
